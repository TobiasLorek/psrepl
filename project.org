#+title: An Powershell Repl for Emacs usign the Windows terminal

The aim of this project is to setup functionality to let emacs interact with powershell running in Windows Terminal.
1. [ ] Send input to a running Windows Terminal with an powershell shell.
2. [ ] Use `eval/send-reigon-to-repl` to send text to a WT Powershell repl
3. [ ] Set breakpoints in the WT PS Repl using the current location in the file
4. [ ] Import the file into the WT PS Repl

 The Non-Goals of this project are:
5. To write  a pure elisp plugin.
6. To be completely selfcontained. It is ok if some manual tweaking is required every time you run it.

* Sending lines to a running powershell process in windows terminal
